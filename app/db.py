"""PostgreSQL access: connection pool, revision lookup and publishing.

All conditional decisions run inside a transaction that locks the
``objects`` row of the path (``SELECT ... FOR SHARE`` for reads,
``FOR UPDATE`` for writes).  Concurrent publishes therefore serialise on
that row, and a streaming GET keeps its share lock until the body has
been fully sent, so the revision selected for the headers can neither
disappear nor be replaced while bytes are streamed.

Copy sessions reuse the same building blocks: the manifest is captured
with ``FOR SHARE`` snapshots, and acknowledging a segment applies its
entries inside a single transaction that takes ``FOR UPDATE`` locks on
the target rows in ascending path order (so concurrent acknowledgements
cannot deadlock).

When a session is created a *revision baseline* is recorded for every
target path in the same snapshot transaction (a NULL revision means the
target did not exist).  Acknowledgements compare the locked target's
current revision identity against that baseline: any publish after the
baseline -- even of byte-identical content -- is reported as a conflict,
because a digest match alone cannot distinguish "unchanged" from
"re-published since the session was pinned".

    Target rows are locked in ascending path order (``FOR UPDATE``), so
    concurrent batches and publishes serialise without deadlocks.  Each
    entry is checked against the revision baseline captured when the
    session was created:

    * baseline missing the revision and target still missing -> create
      the pinned revision as rev 1;
    * baseline revision identity unchanged and digest equal ->
      idempotent no-op (``already_present``);
    * anything else is a conflict -- including a re-publish of the very
      same bytes, which a digest comparison could not distinguish from
      "never changed".

    The caller decides: commit everything, or roll back and report the
    conflicts — never a partial application.
